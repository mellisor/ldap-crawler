# ldap-crawler

Start the program using: 
  
  1. 'python ldap.py -d YOURDOMAIN -u USERNAME -p PASSWORD'
  
  or
  
  2. 'python ldap.py -d YOURDOMAIN -u USERNAME -f FILE'
  
Domain and username are always required and one of either password or file must be present (but not both)
The base domain components also need to be set at the bottom of ldap.py
